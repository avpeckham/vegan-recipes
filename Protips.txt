Unordered collection of pro tips learned by doing
-------------------------------------------------

* Certain things should be washed right after use, or they become really hard
  to clean:

  * lemon, lime, or orange juicers
  * wooden spoons
  * anything that has been in contact with bread batter or dough (the gluten
    gets really hard when it dries)

* Pricey spices are /much/ better than cheap spices. This is especially true
  of ground coriander. The premium is worth it.

* If you have to measure both oil and nectar (honey or agave), then measure
  the oil first. That way the nectar will slide off the measuring device,
  rather than sticking.

* Baked goods: test them for doneness by taking a wooden spoon and pushing
  down lightly on the center of teh good. If it springs back up, it's done.
  This test is more reliable than the "stick a fork in it" test.
