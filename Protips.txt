Unordered collection of pro tips learned along the way
------------------------------------------------------

* Certain things should be washed right after use, or they become really hard
  to clean:

  * lemon, lime, or orange juicers
  * wooden spoons
  * anything that has been in contact with bread batter or dough (the gluten
    gets really hard when it dries)

* Pricey spices are /much/ better than cheap spices. This is especially true
  of ground coriander. The premium is worth it.

* If you have to measure both oil and nectar (honey or agave), then measure
  the oil first. That way the nectar will slide off the measuring device,
  rather than sticking.

* Baked goods: you can test for doneness by taking a wooden spoon and pushing
  down lightly on the center of whatever it is you're baking. If it springs
  back up, it's done. This test is more reliable than the more widely known
  "stick a fork in it" test. Thanks to C for teaching me this one.

* If you're going to freeze bread, use the "light crust" setting (assuming you
  have a bread machine, and it supports that). Also maybe turn up the humidity
  in your freezer. : P
