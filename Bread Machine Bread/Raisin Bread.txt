Raisin bread (specially designed for bread machines)

I found this recipe written by hand on a slip of paper inside a bread machine
book that a friend gave me. Ooh, mystery! I haven't tried it; I don't like
raisins.

3½ cups whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil (olive oil for heavy bread; canola oil for lighter)
1 cup soy milk
3 eggs' equivalent in egg replacer¹
2 tablespoons agave nectar or honey
½ cup raisins
3 tablespoons yeast
5 tablespoons wheat germ

Stir all ingredients together, place in bread pan, and start your bread machine.

Footnotes:

1. I use Ener-G egg replacer. It works well in recipes, and it lasts forever.
Follow the directions on the box.
