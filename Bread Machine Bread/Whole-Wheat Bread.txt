Whole-Wheat Bread

This is my go-to recipe for hearty, yeasty bread to accompany soup.

There are two variants: one for a one-pound loaf, which will work in any bread
machine, and one for a one-and-a-half-pound loaf, which will work only in
bread machines big enough to accomodate that size. Most bread machines can
make one-and-a-half-pound loaves, but check your docs (or play with the
controls, which will have separate settings for each load size).

    1½ Pound Variant

  Ingredient Group 1
½ cup water
½ cup soy milk
1 egg's equivalent in egg replacer¹
1½ teaspoons salt

  Ingredient Group 2
1½ cups whole wheat flour
1½ cups all-purpose flour

  Ingredient Group 3
1½ tablespoons olive oil
1½ tablespoons agave nectar or honey
2 teaspoons yeast

Remove the pan from the bread machine. In the pan, mix the ingredients from
Group 1. Slowly stir in the ingredients from Group 2.  Add the ingredients
from Group 3. Without delay, put the pan in the machine, select 1½ pounds, and
press start.

    1 Pound Variant
Same as above, except:
Use ¼ water.
Replace each instance of 1½ with 1.
Use the 1 pound setting.

    Footnotes:

1. I use Ener-G egg replacer. It works well in recipes, and it lasts forever.
Follow the directions on the box.
