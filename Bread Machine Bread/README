This directory contains recipes for bread (vegan, of course), adjusted to work
well in a bread machine.

You will need to adjust the amount of water according to the ambient humidity
in which you're baking (the higher the humidity, the less water you should
use). I've never figured out a formula for this; it remains a black art to me.
If you have suggestions, please submit a pull request, or email me at
quinn@fairpath.com. Thanks!

PS: I was really tempted to name this directory "Lisp Machine Lisp".
