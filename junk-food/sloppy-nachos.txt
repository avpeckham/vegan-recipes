Sloppy Nachos
=============

Gear
----

1 or 2 baking sheets
A few spoons

Ingredients
-----------

1 bag round, thick corn chips
1 can refried beans (make sure they're marked veg
1 tub Trader Joe's vegan cream cheese
1 jar salsa (Pace Picante is best)
1 can sliced jalapeños

Steps
-----

1. Preheat the over to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. Lay out the chips on the baking sheet, concave side up. It's OK to
   pack them in close.

3. Put a dollop of each ingredient on the chip, one atop the other, in order:

a. Refried beans
b. Cream cheese
c. Salsa
d. Jalapeño (1 slice per chip).

4. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove, let cool, and eat. They're best when they're
   still a little warm.
