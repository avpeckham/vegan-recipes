Vegan Frozen Coconut Brownies
=============================

Gear
----
* One 9"x9" brownie pan
* Optional, but desirable: parchment paper
* A double boiler (that is, a metal pot plus a larger metal bowl to fit into it)
* A whisk
* A wooden spoon
* A spatula

Powder Ingredients
------------------

1/3 cup flour
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1 tsp. baking powder
3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar (I use Splenda, but you shouldn't; it's gross)
1/2 tsp. salt

Non-Powder Ingredients
----------------------

3 oz. coconut oil
8 oz. 70% choc
2 eggs' worth of egg replacer

Steps
-----

1. Preheat over to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. If you have parchment paper, line the pan with it. If you don't
have parchment paper, grease the pan with a small amount of coconut oil,
using your hands to melt it.

2. Melt the Non-Powder Ingredients in a double boiler, stirring
occasionally with the wooden spoon (you create a double boiler by
putting some water in the pot, putting the metal bowl in the pot, and
then turning the heat to High).

3. Meanwhile, whisk the Powder Ingredients in a mixing bowl.

4. Stir the Powder Ingredients into the double boiler.

5. Pour the mixture into a greased (or, better, parchment-paper-lined)
9"x9" baking pan, then bake for 30 to 35 minutes. The brownies are
done when the center springs back up entirely after you depress it
with the wooden spoon.

6. Turn off the oven and remove the brownies. Immediately cut them to
the desired size with the spatula (I cut into a tic tac toe square of
ninths, then cut each ninth diagonally).

Allow the brownies to cool, then refrigerate them. The will freeze
at normal fridge temperatures, because coconut oil has a higher
freezing point than does butter. That's OK; they're delicious that way.
