1. Convert recipes from UTF-8. The Dropbox iPhone app doesn't display UTF-8
   characters properly.

   This entails removing UTF-8 vulgar fractions and replacing accented
   vowels with their unaccented versions (e.g. changing "sauté" to "saute").

2. Convert the recipes to Markdown, but keep the .txt extension
   so that files will open correctly on all platforms.
