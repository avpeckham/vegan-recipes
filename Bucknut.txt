Bucknut

This forms an indescribable rubbery goo. It's like eating Oobleck, except tasty.
It's really fun to eat. Kids would probably love it.

1/4 cup buckwheat flour
1 Tablespoon peanut butter
Salt to taste

1 coffee mug

Put the buckwheat in a mug, add enough water to cover it plus 1/2 inch more,
and microwave for 90 seconds to 2 minutes, stirring every 20 seconds.

Take out the mug and stir in the peanut butter. Stir in salt to taste.

Eat with a spoon.

Immediately soak the the mug and spoons in water plus dish soap.
If you don't, they will get really hard to clean.
