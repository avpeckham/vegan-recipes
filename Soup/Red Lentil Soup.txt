Indian Red Lentil Soup

    Basics

1 large yellow onion
1/2 lb. kale (optional)
2 large lemons
15 oz. can peeled, seeded, diced or whole tomatoes
1 1/2 cups red lentils
6 cups vegetable stock
olive oil
salt

    Spices

2 tsp peeled and grated fresh ginger
2 tbsp ground coriander
2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
pinch of cayenne pepper

Rinse the lentils in a pasta drainer.

Chop the onion and saut√© it till translucent, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, measure all the spices. When the onion is ready, add the spices,
turn the heat to low, and cook, stirring, about 3 minutes.

Add the lentils and stock. Turn up the heat to high. Bring to a boil, then
turn heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or more.

Turn off the heat. Stir in the tomatoes, juice the lemons into the mix, and
add salt to taste. If you're using kale, stir it in, poke it down into the
soup, and let it sit till it gets nice and wilty. Remove from heat and serve.

    Pro tips:

Don't forget to stir, or the soup will burn on the bottom of your pot!

The longer you simmer, the better the soup tastes. If you simmer for a long
time, you might need to add water to compensate for the water lost as steam.
