Vegan Cornbread

Gear
----

An 8" or 9" square baking pan (or a 12-muffin pan)

Prep
----

Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

Grease[2] the pan.

Powdered ingredients
--------------------

* 1 1/4 cups cornmeal
* 3/4 cups flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons sugar, or one packet stevia, or (as I prefer) no sweetener

Liquid ingredients
------------------

* 2 eggs' equivalent in egg replacer[1]
* 2/3 cup unsweetened soy milk
* Fake buttermilk: 5/8 cup unsweetened soy milk
  whisked together with 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 3 tablespoons melted butter replacer[2]

Instructions
------------

1. Whisk together the powdered ingredients.

2. Separately, whisk together the liquid ingredients.

3. Pour the liquid ingredients over the powdered ingredients
   and whisk till they form a grainy, lumpy, heterogeneous paste.

4. Pour this mixture into the pan.

5. Bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Muffins take 10 to 15 minutes;
   bread takes 20 to 25 minutes. Check after the first interval.

Pro tip
-------

The cornbread is done if, when you push it down lightly with a wooden spoon
in its center, it springs back up. This test is more reliable than the
"stick a fork in it" test.

Footnotes
---------

[1] I use Ener-G brand egg replacer. Follow the directions on the box.

[2] I use Harvest Award brand butter replacer. It's made without palm oil,
    which makes it better than Earth Balance for ecology and land use.
